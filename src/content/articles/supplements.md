I want to document my experiments with
[peaty](https://twitter.com/search?q=peaty) supplements that I've tried. I'll
divide the list in two: abandoned and active. Let's start with abandoned.

## Abandoned

### Pregnenolone

Took 100mg of
[this brand](https://www.lifeextension.com/vitamins-supplements/item00700/pregnenolone)
every morning for a month. No effects.

### Methylene Blue

This is the most interesting substance I've ever taken, teaches you a lot about
your body and the range of effects is big.

Took **4-10 drops of 1% solution (2-5mg) in the morning** for around a month.

#### Upside:

- Clears white tongue (I had gut overgrowth, experienced 2-3 weeks of die-off
  symptoms).
- Clears warts. Not all of them, but in a month at least one of my warts
  disappeared.
- Slightly reduces anxiety. But sometimes amplifies it. Confusing.

#### Downside:

- Lowers libido, worsens erections. Apparently
  [nitric oxide plays key role in erections](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11336572/)
  and MB inhibits NO synthesis.

## Active

Still experimenting with these:

### Coffee

Improves quality of life. Drink **1+ cups a day**. No downside.

### Aspirin

Another simple one. Upside: improves erections and orgasms. Downside: worsens
muscle hypertrophy.

Take **300-500mg** when my girl's coming over or when I'm not training.

### Baking soda

#### Upside:

- Improves gym performance and recovery.
- Induces slight euphoria.

#### Downside:

- I don't like the bowel movements. Still experimenting.

Take **0.5-1 tsp** before training.

## Cyproheptadine

#### Pros:

- Improves appetite.
- Reduces laziness.

#### Cons:

- Groggy for 24h.

Take **1mg** before bed when sleep gets bad or apathy/laziness sets in. Nukes
serotonin.

## Coconut oil

**1 tbsp in coffee**. Makes me toasty. No downside.

## Garlic

**As much as you want**. Improves libido. No downside.

## Alcohol

## Creatine

## Pregnenolone

Didn't work.
